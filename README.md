# Pathfinding Visualizer

Welcome to Pathfinding Visualizer! I built this application because I wanted to learn and implement pathfinding algorithms.You can access it here (use Google Chrome!) https://vardapanchal005.github.io/Pathfinding-Visualizer/
## Meet the Algorithms


This application supports the following algorithms
#### Dijkstra's Algorithm (weighted)
The father of pathfinding algorithms; guarantees the shortest path.

#### A Search* (weighted)
Arguably the best pathfinding algorithm; uses heuristics to guarantee the shortest path much faster than Dijkstra's Algorithm.

#### Greedy Best-first Search (weighted)
A faster, more heuristic-heavy version of A*; does not guarantee the shortest path.

#### Swarm Algorithm (weighted)
A mixture of Dijkstra's Algorithm and A*; does not guarantee the shortest-path.

#### Convergent Swarm Algorithm (weighted)
the faster, more heuristic-heavy version of Swarm; does not guarantee the shortest path

#### Bidirectional Swarm Algorithm (weighted)
Swarm from both sides; does not guarantee the shortest path.

#### Breath-first Search (unweighted)
A great algorithm; guarantees the shortest path.

#### Depth-first Search (unweighted)
A very bad algorithm for pathfinding; does not guarantee the shortest path.

On top of the pathfinding algorithms listed above, I implemented a Recursive Division Maze Generation algorithm.
